# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users

# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age = 25
# 2. name
name = "John"
# 3. song
song = "Happy Birthday"
# 4. food
food = "Apples"
# 5. number
number = 1000

# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
#concatenation
print ("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " old coder named " + name + ".")
#f string
print (f"Once upon a time, there was a {age} old coder named {name}.")

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?
